		<h2 id="cotext1"> Introduction </h2>
		<p id="subtext1"> The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical </p>
		<p id="subtext2"> and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers </p>
		<p id="subtext3"> and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human  </p>
		<p id="subtext4"> to-computer interaction.  </p>
		
		<p id="subtext5"> A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm </p>
		<p id="subtext6"> animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver  </p>
		<p id="subtext7"> when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned  </p>
		<p id="subtext8"> an Internet Protocol (IP) address and is able to transfer data over a network.  </p>
		
		<p id="subtext9"> Increasingly, organizations in a variety of industries are using IoT to operate more efficiently, </p>
		<p id="subtext10"> better understand customers to deliver enhanced customer service, improve decision-  </p>
		<p id="subtext11"> making and increase the value of the business. (Gillis, 2021) </p>

		<h2 id="cotext2"> How does IoT work? </h2>
		<p id="subtext12"> An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such </p>
		<p id="subtext13"> as processors, sensors and communication hardware, to collect, send and act on data they </p>
		<p id="subtext14"> acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by  </p>
		<p id="subtext15"> connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to  </p>
		
		<p id="subtext16"> be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related </p>
		<p id="subtext17"> devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the  </p>
		<p id="subtext18"> work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for  </p>
		<p id="subtext19"> instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data. (Gillis, 2021) </p>
		
		<h2 id="cotext3"> Why is IoT important? </h2>
		<p id="subtext20"> The internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control </p>
		<p id="subtext21"> over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to </p>
		<p id="subtext22"> business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their systems really work,  </p>
		<p id="subtext23"> delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and </p>
		<p id="subtext27">logistics operations.  </p>
		
		<p id="subtext24"> IoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on </p>
		<p id="subtext25"> waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and deliver  </p>
		<p id="subtext26"> goods, as well as offering transparency into customer transactions. (Gillis, 2021) </p>
